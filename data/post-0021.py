<p>Ages ago, I came across a post by <a href=http://eignerchris.tumblr.com/>Chris Eigner</a> that succinctly delineates the genetic aglorithm based programming method, exemplified with a terse, no-frills example written in <a href=http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/>Ruby</a>. Impressed by the simplicity of his code, I quickly whipped up an implementation in <a href=http://python.org>Python</a>. Weeks turned into months, as I continued to put off posting the code here.</p>

<p><a href=http://eignerchris.tumblr.com/post/428590094/genetic-programming-101-ruby>See his implementation</a> for a fantastic explanation of what is happening.</p>
