<p>I have made an official release of the graph traversal engine, codenamed Alice, today. Alice is an experimental graph traversal algorithm, based loosely on the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search>Breadth-First Search</a>, and having the properties <a href=http://motomastyle.com/view/11/>listed in one of my previous posts</a>. For you readers who are curious, you may pick up the path-finding library, its source code, and a small demonstration from the <a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/motomabase>MotomaBASE Sourceforge Page</a>. If anyone takes the time to try it out and play with it, please post your thought here so I can know what you think of it.</p>
