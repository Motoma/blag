<p>Soon after buying my Video iPod, I wanted to put my massive library of videos onto it, so I could watch them on long trips without carrying along my entire laptop. I wrote a small shell script to perform the mundane task of converting for me, using the free, open-source tool ffmpeg (<a href="http://ffmpeg.org">http://ffmpeg.org</a>).</p>

<!-- break -->

<h4>Shell Script for iPod Video Conversion</h4>:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/830174.js?file=video2ipod"></script>

<p>After copying this to a file, you must give the script execute permissions:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/862295.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>

<p>To run the script, you supply it with a file to convert, as well as the desired output file:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/862296.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>

<p>Voila! Your video is ready to be loaded onto your iPod!</p>

<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Motoma</p>
