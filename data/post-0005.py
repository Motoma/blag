<p>Ilfak Guilfanov of DataRescue Inc (the people behind <a href="http://www.datarescue.com/idabase/">IDA Pro</a>) has posted an entry on his <a href="http://hexblog.com"]Hex Blog</a> titled <a href="http://hexblog.com/2007/04/decompilation_gets_real.html">Decompilation Gets Real</a>. In it he announces the beta testing of a tool which, when given a binary file, produces accurate and well formatted C code. The immediate consequence of such a tool is the further reduction of the level of knowledge which a would-be hacker must have. Since compilers and assemblers have a distinct optimization fingerprint, it should not be long before automated tools, build from this code regeneration tool, will provide reverse-engineers and crackers with the ability to quickly and efficiently scrub through code for security weaknesses; buffer overflow, format string attacks, and any number of other exploits will be trivial to discover.</p>

<p>The speed and easy in which Guilfanov is able to go through code is what scares me. Take a look at the <a href="http://hexblog.com/decompilation/video/vd1.html">Decompilation Demo</a>.</p>
