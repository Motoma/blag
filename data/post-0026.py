<p>Do you know where this came from:</p>

<blockquote>
"All of you are finished.
You shall forever kneel in my shadow,
and forever live your life in this cursed land.
You will never enjoy seeing the sun rise with joy.
You will never enjoy seeing the relief of watching the sun set.
You will now live in darkness and die in darkness.
Miserable clods, weep in your misfortune.
Despair will become your bread,
and death will become your peace."

<p>Anyone?</p>
