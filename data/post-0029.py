<p>Do you ever find yourself in a protocol sniffing situation where you wish you had the ability to sneak a peak at a TCP stream as it happens? Do you find Wireshark--while certainly a powerful and robust tool--too clunky for quick protocol analysis? Do you have a need to intercept, pause, modify, and resend TCP streams? If so, the folks from Matasano have released the perfect tool for you!</p>

<p>Introducing the Matasano Port Forwarding Interceptor! Simply run the tool from a command line and it builds you a lightweight proxy, allowing you to read, record, pause, intercept, and modify a TCP conversation mid-stream. The tool is simple to use; you picking your remote and local addresses and ports, the tool will bring up two windows--one for viewing and halting traffic, one for editing local and remote traffic. The tool is really simple to use, easy to understand, and it gets the job done.</p>

<p>You can read the full introduction to the tool from Matasano's website: <a href=http://www.matasano.com/log/1693/matasano-pfi-as-seen-on-tv/>http://www.matasano.com/log/1693/matasano-pfi-as-seen-on-tv/</a></p>
