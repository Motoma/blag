<p>I have been recruited to work on a <a href=http://sf.net/projects/slipstream/>new Sourceforge.net project</a> called Slipstream. We are still in the design and layout phase, but we have some hard-hitting experts in on the project and there are great ideas kicking around.</p>

<p>Character generation, and rendering engines are slated, the UI is going through some heavy construction, and I am tackling an AI path-finding engine which is approximately 35% complete.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more on this project as we get our modules up in the repository.</p>
