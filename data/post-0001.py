<p>I decided to buy a new toy for myself this weekend. The product: iriver's H10 20GB MP3 Player. I arrived at home and charged it up only to turn it on and realize that the blasted thing would not work out of the box. I struggled for three hours searching online, upgrading firmware, and sitting on the phone with tech support, all with the same outcome: a brick which would could not get past a screen which says "BOOT 1.01 MTP Initialize." In frustration I cried out, but unfortunately for me, Staples was closed by the time I decided to return it. In one last-ditch effort, I scoured the interweb and found instructions for getting my $200 paperweight to play music.</p>

<p><b>Steps for Repairing my iriver H10 20GB MP3 Player</b></p>

<ol>
	<li>Attach the player to the PC via the USB cord.</li>
	<li>Press the reset button with a paperclip.</li>
	<li>While holding down the O button, power on the device. "USB Connected" is displayed on the screen.</li>
	<li>In My Computer, there is a new Hard Drive for the H10. Right-click the icon and select Format.</li>
	<li>Select FAT32 and Select Quick Format. Format the device.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.iriveramerica.com/support/hd/H10_upgrade.aspx">Download the H10 Upgrade utility</a>. The site states that this does not work for the 20GB model, BUT THEY ARE LYING (partially).</li>
	<li>Run the firmware Upgrade utility. It had some problems, and I needed to run it a few times to get it to completely download the firmware upgrade.</li>
	<li>hen the process is done, unplug the iriver, and it will reboot 2 or 3 times.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.iriveramerica.com/support/mtpupdate/">Download the latest MTP Updater</a>. Follow the updating instructions on the site.</li>
</ol>

<p>After following these instructions, I had a working H10. If you find this useful, leave me a little message.</p>
