<p>I would just like to once again express how unequivocally pleased I am that Microsoft has produced free versions of their Visual Studio IDE, aptly titled <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/>Visual Studio Express</a>. A product such as this is a boon to both the software megalith and individual developers alike. It allows would-be developers the freedom to explore the options at hand, without the moral dilemma of pirating software.</p>

<p>I'll shut up now,</p>
<p>Motoma</p>
