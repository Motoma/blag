<p>As my knowledge of <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> continues to grow, I find myself using it more in my own systems. This is one of my more useful snippets of code; it allows a Python script to continue running as a daemon even if you log out or your session gets disconnected. A nice side effect of this is that the process is immediately run in the background, returning the user to a command prompt instantly.</p><p>I originally picked up the code to run a Python script as a daemon from the <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/66012">Python Cookbook</a> on the <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/">ActiveState Programmer Network</a>.</p>
